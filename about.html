        <p>Hi! I’m Md Tousif Hasan Labib, a science student with a deep passion for learning, creativity, and technology. 
            I completed my schooling at BIAM Laboratory School and College, and I’m currently studying at 
            Ahamed Uddin Shah Shishu Niketon School and College, under the Science group.
            <br><br>
            I’ve always been curious about how things work — from the smallest atoms in Physics to the biggest ideas 
            in programming. My main hobbies are coding and music, coding allows me to express creativity in unique ways.
             I love exploring new technologies, building useful digital tools, and sometimes spending time listening to music to relax my mind.
            <br><br>
            My goal is to keep growing as a learner, improve my coding skills, and one day create something meaningful that
             helps people in their everyday lives.
            <br><br>
            Thanks for visiting my page — and welcome to my digital space!</p>
